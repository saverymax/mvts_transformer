I am treating this work as an opportunity to learn more about testing in Pytorch. Here are the resources I've looked at.

- https://theaisummer.com/unit-test-deep-learning/
- Pytorch lightning is especially good: https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/tree/master/tests/models
- Nice template for coding projects: https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template
- https://www.reddit.com/r/pytorch/comments/kd2dk4/testing_framework/
